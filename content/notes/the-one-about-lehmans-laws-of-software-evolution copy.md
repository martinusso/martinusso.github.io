A simple and powerful way to keep an engineering team efficient, collaborative, and high-quality is limiting the number of active projects.
Iâ€™ve been following a straightforward formula:

## The Basic Formula

`Ideal number of projects = number of people on the team / 2`

The idea is that every project **should have at least two people involved**. That helps avoid risks like individual overload, lack of peer review, context loss, and bottlenecks when someoneâ€™s unavailable.

## Why two or more people per project works so well

Having at least two engineers on a project brings advantages like

- **Resilience:** one person can go on vacation, have day-offs, get sick, or switch teams - and the project still moves forward.
- **Knowledge sharing:** avoids silos and keeps critical context spread across more than one person. Chances are, you get better and more consistent documentation when isnâ€™t a one-person project.
- **Code quality:** there's always someone to review, question, or improve a solution.
- **Better decision-making:** collaboration usually leads to more thoughtful and sustainable technical choices.

In short, it helps you **avoid the "one-person project"** which is fragile, risky, and hard to sustain over time.

## Healthy WIP (Work In Progress) Ranges

Healthy WIP ranges bring transparency and help teams stay focused. A good tip is to use the following table:

| Range            | Description                                             | Project Count       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| ðŸ”¹ Ideal         | Steady focus and high efficiency                        | Up to 7 projects    |
| ðŸ”¸ Risk Zone     | Upper limit - be mindful of focus and allocation        | 8 to 9 projects     |
| ðŸ”º Critical Zone | Spread too thin - lower efficiency and unpredictability | 10 or more projects |

_The project count column is an example based on a 15-person team._

### Mapping Risk and Critical Zones

Beyond the ideal scenario, there are moments when a team might need to allocate just one person to a project (unfortunately, it's not all sunshine and rainbows).
While this can be manageable in specific cases, a critical threshold is reached when more than 25% of the team is working solo on separate projects.
This often results in constant context switching, decreased quality, slower delivery times, and reduced efficiency.

**Itâ€™s not just about how many projects are in progress, but how the teamâ€™s attention and collaboration are distributed.**

### Why one-person projects are dangerous

One-person projects have a serious downsides that hurt both delivery and team health

- **Individual dependency:** if that person leaves or takes time off, the project stalls. And even when someone new joins, progress is slow.
- **Lower quality:** no assertive reviews often means more blind spots and suboptimal decisions.
- **Little context sharing:** the knowledge lives in one head, which isnâ€™t sustainable.
- **Unpredictability:** without a teammate, it's harder to maintain progress and address issues early.
- **Higher burnout risk:** working alone with too much responsibility and no one to lean on increases stress over time.

## Final thoughts

Limiting the number of active projects, and making sure no one is working alone isnâ€™t about slowing things down
Itâ€™s about protecting the long-term rhythm, quality, and health of your team.
