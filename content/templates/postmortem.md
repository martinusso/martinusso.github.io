Brief, factual summary of what happened, the impact, and the outcome.
Avoid blame or judgment.

_Illustrative example (literary):_
Romeo and Juliet fell in love despite a long-standing feud between their families.
A secret relationship led to misunderstandings, cascading failures, and ultimately
the loss of both lives.

## Root cause

Describe the underlying systemic causes that led to the incident.
Focus on _why the system allowed this to happen_, not on individual mistakes.

- Technical factors
- Process gaps
- Communication failures
- Organizational constraints

_Illustrative example (literary):_

- Unresolved historical conflict between the Montague and Capulet families.
- Critical message from Friar Laurence was not delivered in time.
- Decisions were made without validation or shared visibility.

## Investigation

- Initial signals or alerts
- Early hypotheses (including incorrect ones)
- Evidence collected
- How the correct cause was identified

_Illustrative example (literary):_

- Initial signals: rumors in Verona about secret meetings.

- Evidence: testimonies, exchanged letters, sightings.
- Correct discovery: a secret marriage facilitated by Friar Laurence.

## Corrective actions
