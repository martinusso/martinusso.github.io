  <h1>The Two-Person Project Rule: Focus, Collaboration, and Sustainable Delivery</h1>
  <p>A simple and powerful way to keep an engineering team efficient, collaborative, and high-quality is limiting the number of active projects.
Iâ€™ve been following a straightforward formula:</p>
<h2 id="the-basic-formula">The Basic Formula</h2>
<p><code>Ideal number of projects = number of people on the team / 2</code></p>
<p>The idea is that every project <strong>should have at least two people involved</strong>. That helps avoid risks like individual overload, lack of peer review, context loss, and bottlenecks when someoneâ€™s unavailable.</p>
<h2 id="why-two-or-more-people-per-project-works-so-well">Why two or more people per project works so well</h2>
<p>Having at least two engineers on a project brings advantages like</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resilience:</strong> one person can go on vacation, have day-offs, get sick, or switch teams - and the project still moves forward.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge sharing:</strong> avoids silos and keeps critical context spread across more than one person. Chances are, you get better and more consistent documentation when isnâ€™t a one-person project.</li>
<li><strong>Code quality:</strong> there&rsquo;s always someone to review, question, or improve a solution.</li>
<li><strong>Better decision-making:</strong> collaboration usually leads to more thoughtful and sustainable technical choices.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, it helps you <strong>avoid the &ldquo;one-person project&rdquo;</strong> which is fragile, risky, and hard to sustain over time.</p>
<h2 id="healthy-wip-work-in-progress-ranges">Healthy WIP (Work In Progress) Ranges</h2>
<p>Healthy WIP ranges bring transparency and help teams stay focused. A good tip is to use the following table:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Range</th>
          <th>Description</th>
          <th>Project Count</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>ðŸ”¹ Ideal</td>
          <td>Steady focus and high efficiency</td>
          <td>Up to 7 projects</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>ðŸ”¸ Risk Zone</td>
          <td>Upper limit - be mindful of focus and allocation</td>
          <td>8 to 9 projects</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>ðŸ”º Critical Zone</td>
          <td>Spread too thin - lower efficiency and unpredictability</td>
          <td>10 or more projects</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p><em>The project count column is an example based on a 15-person team.</em></p>
<h3 id="mapping-risk-and-critical-zones">Mapping Risk and Critical Zones</h3>
<p>Beyond the ideal scenario, there are moments when a team might need to allocate just one person to a project (unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not all sunshine and rainbows).
While this can be manageable in specific cases, a critical threshold is reached when more than 25% of the team is working solo on separate projects.
This often results in constant context switching, decreased quality, slower delivery times, and reduced efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Itâ€™s not just about how many projects are in progress, but how the teamâ€™s attention and collaboration are distributed.</strong></p>
<h3 id="why-one-person-projects-are-dangerous">Why one-person projects are dangerous</h3>
<p>One-person projects have a serious downsides that hurt both delivery and team health</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individual dependency:</strong> if that person leaves or takes time off, the project stalls. And even when someone new joins, progress is slow.</li>
<li><strong>Lower quality:</strong> no assertive reviews often means more blind spots and suboptimal decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Little context sharing:</strong> the knowledge lives in one head, which isnâ€™t sustainable.</li>
<li><strong>Unpredictability:</strong> without a teammate, it&rsquo;s harder to maintain progress and address issues early.</li>
<li><strong>Higher burnout risk:</strong> working alone with too much responsibility and no one to lean on increases stress over time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Limiting the number of active projects, and making sure no one is working alone isnâ€™t about slowing things down
Itâ€™s about protecting the long-term rhythm, quality, and health of your team.</p>
